subtitle: Display defect detection through machine learning image recognition

---
Display front-of-screen is a very key component of devices like iPhone, iPad, etc, as users spend an inordinate amount of time staring at and interact with every day. The quality of display front-of-screen will dramatically affect users’ experience, which we value the most at Apple. For each new product release, Apple will innovate its display to deliver an optimal viewing experience. In order to deliver the high-quality display front-of-screen, it involves numerous effects from initial design to production and quality control process.

_Display front-of-screen inspection from module vendor to assembly line_

### Problem

Apple has long used computer vision to inspect display front-of-screen and the inspection at the product assembly line serves as the gatekeeper of quality control. In the current inspection workflow, firstly the test station returns ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’ for each device, followed by the inspectors to double-check for both ‘Pass’ and ‘Fail’ results. However, there’re two main constraints in this workflow: for test station, traditionally involved hard-coded and pre-defined rules cannot capture unanticipated defects, like arbitrary and vague defects, making it less sensitive to defect pattern changes; for inspectors, it is easy to make a biased and wrong judgment due to insufficient working experiences and eye fatigue.

To tackle above challenges, AI/ML China Team partnered with Display Hardware Testing Engineering Team (HWTE), and successfully delivered machine learning solutions to transform the subjective test to a smarter and more autonomous way.

##### Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions](https://gethugothemes.com)

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](https://www.getjekyllthemes.com).

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com) and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

##### Blockquote

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
<dt>Definition list</dt>
<dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

<dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
<dd>Does _not_ work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables | Are | Cool |
| --- | :---: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Still | renders | nicely |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
