The playbook aims to facilitate the collaborations between your team and MI Team to create and scale machine learning solutions for visual inspection & quality control.

#### Background

###### **Visual Inspection in Manufacturing**

Visual Inspection is routinely carried out across manufacturing by human operators or by automatic optical inspection (AOI) machines to determine whether a device or component meets the specified quality standards.

Typical examples are:

* Distinguish a ‘good’ device (or component) from a bad one
* Locate the defect and identify its category (or severity)

###### **Challenges**

* Subjective & Unreliable

Operators' decisions are inconsistent on limit samples (defects at the quality borderline can be judged as either 'OK' or 'NG'). Operators will have illusion due to ‘afterimage’, that is, an image continues to appear in the eyes after a period of exposure to the original image, causing unreliable judgement.

* Eye fatigue

Inspectors often suffer from eye fatigue and other health issues caused by repetitive inspection over long hours.

* Labour cost

To train a novice to an experienced operator is a costly venture, while labor cost is increasing. With the increase in the number of testing items brought by new technologies, a large number of new workers are in demand in the NPI (New Product Introduction) stage.
